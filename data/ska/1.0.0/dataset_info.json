  "description": "The SKA Science Data Challenge #1 (SDC1) release consists of 9 files, \nwith the format of FITS images. Each file is a simulated SKA continuum image \nin total intensity of the same field at 3 frequencies (560 MHz, representative \nof SKA Mid Band 1, 1.4 GHz, representative of SKA Mid Band 2 and 9.2 GHz, \nrepresentative of SKA Mid Band 5) and 3 telescope integrations (8, 100, 1000 h \nas representative of a single, medium-depth and deep integration, respectively).",
